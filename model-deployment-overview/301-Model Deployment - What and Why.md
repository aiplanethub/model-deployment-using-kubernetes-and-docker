## Learning Objectives
* What is Model Deployment?
* Why Model Deployment?



### Imagine

* You have spent several weeks or months building a machine learning model that would identify if a person has put a mask on their face or not with an excellent accuracy score.
* Sounds great, right? Is this all you wanted?
* No. Building a model is generally not the end of the project.
* You would want your model to be used in real-time where it could identify people in parks, at bus stations, streets, etc., with no mask and immediately inform the people nearby to maintain sufficient distance.
* This is where model deployment comes into the picture.


## What Is Model Deployment?

* The concept of deployment in data science refers to applying the model for prediction using new data.
* In other words, model deployment means using your trained ML model to predict new data available to users or other systems.
* In technical terms, model deployment means integrating a machine learning model into an existing production environment where it can take in an input and return an output.

## Why Model Deployment?

* A machine learning model can begin to add value to an organization only when that model’s insight is timely available to the users for which it was built.
* Even if the model aims to increase the knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained should be organized and presented in a way that a customer will use it.
* If you directly present the model’s code, the customers cannot understand. You need to provide a user interface.
* To achieve this, you need to deploy the model on the web.
